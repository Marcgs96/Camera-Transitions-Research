# Camera Transitions

## What are camera transitions?

In films or videos, camera transitions are a post-production technique used to connect one shot with another. Simple enough, but what about video games?

Although the purpose is practically the same. In videogames, camera transitions won’t be a post-production technique, but a slice of code being executed seconds before - while - and after a scene change.
  
A camera transition can also be a smooth movement of the camera through the scene, without the need for a scene change.

## The reasons behind camera transitions

**Why don’t we use just a basic cut where one scene is instantly replaced by the next one?**

In cinema, there’s no problem using a basic cut, because there are no existing delays or freezes between the scene change. So filmmakers use complex or more artistic transitions most commonly to spice up the narrative or move backward or forward in time.

While in video games, when we change a scene, the game unloads the current scene and loads the entering scene information, making the game freeze for a small period of time. So if we don’t use any transition to ‘hide’ that freeze moment, the scene change will look really sketchy, poor or like a bug. Camera transitions are useful to tell the player; “ok, we are moving into another place of the game”.

Like in films, we also use camera transitions with a narrative or aesthetic background.
